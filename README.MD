Project Euler Solutions
----------
Code doodles for problems on Projet Euler. Primarily for personal
use/reference/practice in multiple languages, but feedback is welcome.

Notes
---------
* Lot more problems solved on paper pseudocode that I need to convert
  into actual code
* Problem 3 and 4 are currently terrible (originally written when I
  was first playing around with Python). They do the job, but not well.
